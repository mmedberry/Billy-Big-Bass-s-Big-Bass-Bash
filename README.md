# Billy Big Bass's Big Bass Bash
This is a small project we are doing for an embedded systems class (Cpr E 388) at Iowa State University. The goal of this project is to create an interactive fishing simulation app for Android. This app will simulate the feel of fishing with realistic motion controls and device feedback. The user will be able to see statistics (e.g. weight, length) on which types of fish they have caught, and their record-setting fish.
### Required Functionality
1. The app initially loads to a splash screen where user can navigate to go fishing or view records.
1. User can catch fish.
1. User can save caught fish data.
1. User can see past record setting fish.
1. User can cast by physically moving the phone in a casting motion.
1. User will reel in by moving the phone in a circular motion, mimicking reeling-in.
1. User can feel feedback from fish in the form of phone vibration.
1. The app will include animation when reeling in the fish.
1. After catching a fish a success screen will display with the fishâ€™s statistics.
1. There will be multiple types of fish with different stat ranges and difficulties.
1. (Optional) There will be multiple locations (e.g. river, lake, sea) with different types of fish in each location.
